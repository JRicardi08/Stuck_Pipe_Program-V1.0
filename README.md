# Stuck_Pipe_Program-V1.1
During drilling operations, a pipe is considered stuck if it cannot be freed from the hole without damaging the pipe, and without exceeding the drilling rig’s maximum allowed hook load. 

Pipe sticking can be classified under two categories: differential pressure pipe sticking and mechanical pipe sticking.

Why is it so important to determine the mechanism of stuck pipe?

If you know the cause of stuck pipe, you will be able to free your pipe correctly. However, if you cannot correctly identify a root cause of stuck pipe, your drill string may be in the hol forever!!!

Many people in the oil field, including me, use the guidelines from the famous stuck pipe prevention book, named “TRUE,” which belongs to Amoco. It is extremely useful and so easy to understand.
